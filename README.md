A [BlueMap](https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap) addon that adds [Geyser/Floodgate](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Floodgate) support:
by default, Floodgate players don't have the correct playerhead image on BlueMap. This plugin fixes that.

This is a Native BlueMap Addon, so it should be compatible with
all platforms that BlueMap supports!\
Just put the `.jar` file in BlueMap's `packs/` directory, and it should work out of the box.
